            Mediation sessions are run by profressionals who help you try to reach an agreement without going to court.
            It isn't relationship counselling and you don't have to be in the same room as the other parent.

          <p className="govuk-body">
            <strong>Choose Professional mediation if...</strong> <br /> You both want to reach an agreement but need help from someone
            who is independent.

    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Going to court</h1>

    <p>You'll need to go to court if you've tried other suitable options and still can't agree arrangements, or you're
      worried about the welfare of you or your children.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Court:</h2>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>can take a long time</li>
      <li>can be expensive and stressful</li>
      <li>often takes more than one court session to get a resolution</li>
      <li>results in a legal judgement that can be enforced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works:</h2>
    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>Find out if you can get representation.</li>
      <li>You must attend an initial mediation meeting, known as a Mediation Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM)
        before going to court, or <a class="govuk-link"

    <!-- Start: Arbitration -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Arbitration</h3>
    <p>In family arbitration, you and the other person choose a qualified, impartial professional to hear both of your
      views. They will then make a decision that you both have agreed to.</p>

    <p>The other parent will need to agree to arbitration and you’ll need to describe which issues it is you want to
      resolve.</p>

    <p>You get to choose how you want to participate in arbitration. For example, you can decide for the case to be
      dealt with on paper, or you can attend telephone or in-person meetings with the arbitrator.</p>

    <p>This approach means that you don't have to deal directly with the other parent if you don’t want to.</p>
     
    <p>You can also hire a lawyer to support you as part of the process. The type of lawyer you use is called a
      solicitor.</p>

    <p>Arbitration: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>needs you to be able to agree what the issues are to resolve</li>
      <li>is usually quicker and more flexible than going to court</li>
      <li>is expensive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The agreement reached will not be legally binding. You can ask your lawyer to submit it to court to make it
      legally binding if that is what you want. </p>

    <!-- Start: Lawyer negotiation -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-9">Lawyer negotiation</h3>
    <p>When you resolve your child arrangements using lawyer negotiation, you hire a lawyer to negotiate arrangements
      for you. The type of lawyer you use is called a solicitor. Often the other parent will also use a lawyer and the
      two lawyers will speak directly to one another. This approach means that you don't have to deal directly with the
      other parent if you don’t want to. </p>

    <p>You can still hire a lawyer to negotiate on your behalf even if the other parent chooses not to use one.</p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation can be a good option if your relationship is difficult and you'd prefer not to meet, or if you
      don’t trust the other parent. It can be expensive. It may be quicker and less stressful than court.</p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>means you don’t have to deal with the other parent directly</li>
      <li>is usually quicker and less stressful than going to court</li>
      <li>can be expensive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The agreement reached will not be legally binding. You can ask your lawyer to submit it to court to make it
      legally binding if that is what you want.</p>

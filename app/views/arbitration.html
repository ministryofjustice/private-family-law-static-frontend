    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">You could consider family arbitration to resolve your child arrangements.</h2>

    <p>In family arbitration, you and the other person choose a qualified, impartial professional to hear both of your
      views. They will then make a decision that you both have to agree to follow.</p>

    <p>Arbitration:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>is usually quicker and more flexible than going to court​</li>
      <li>is expensive</li>

        <p>The other parent will need to agree to arbitration and you'll need to be able to agree on which issues it is
          you want to focus on.</p>

        <p>You get to choose how you want to participate in arbitration. For example, you can decide for the case to be
          dealt with on paper, or you can attend telephone or in-person meetings with the arbitrator. This approach
          means that you don't have to deal directly with the other parent if you don't want to.</p>

        <p>You can also hire a lawyer to support you as part of the process. The type of lawyer you use is called a
          solicitor.</p>

         <p>The agreement reached will not be legally binding. You can ask your lawyer to submit it to court to make it
          legally binding if that is what you want.</p>

        <p>How it works:</p>

          <li>Both of you complete an application form describing the issues you want to fix and whether you want to

          <li>Take part in arbitration in the way you want, such as by phone or on paper.</li>
          <li>Get a decision in writing which you must both follow.</li>

    <p>When you make or change your child arrangements using lawyer negotiation, you hire a lawyer to negotiate
      arrangements for you. This means that you don't have to deal directly with the other parent if you don't want to.
    </p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>is usually quicker and less stressful than going to court</li>

        <p>Lawyer negotiation can be a good option if your relationship is difficult and you'd prefer not to meet, or if
          you don't trust the other parent.</p>

        <p>You can still hire a lawyer to negotiate on your behalf even if the other parent chooses not to use one. The
          type of lawyer you use is called a solicitor. Often the other parent will also use a lawyer and the two
          lawyers will speak directly to one another.</p>

        <p>The agreement reached will not be legally binding. You can ask your lawyer to submit it to court to make it
          legally binding if that is what you want.</p>

        <p>How it works:</p>

          <li>Hire a lawyer.</li>
          <li>Meet with your lawyer to explain what you want to achieve.</li>

    <!-- Start: Going to court -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-9">Going to court</h3>

    <p>You'll need to go to court if you've tried other suitable options and still can't agree arrangements, or you're
      worried about the welfare of you or your children.</p>

    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-6">Court:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>can take a long time</li>
      <li>can be expensive and stressful</li>
      <li>often takes more than one court session to get a resolution</li>
      <li>results in a legal judgement that can be enforced</li>

    <p>The best route for you is to agree child arrangements using the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">Make a child
        arrangements plan service</a>.</p>

    <p>You will create suggestions for your child arrangements and the other parent will be able to respond until you
      both reach agreement. At the end, you will have a written plan in place that can help give children security and
      stability. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Mediation may be the best way for you to make child arrangements. </h2>

    <p>Mediation is not relationship counselling.</p>

    <p>Family mediation is a process in which an independent, professionally trained mediator helps you and the other
      parent or carer work out your child arrangements. The mediator is a professional who will work with you to help
      you make decisions based on your child's best interests. They listen to both sides and take a neutral approach.​
    </p>
    ​
    <p>Mediation can also be helpful if you're updating your existing child arrangements. You may find it less stressful
      than going to court.​</p>
    ​
    <p>The mediator will help you find a solution which works for you both and will explain what needs to happen to make
      an agreement between you legally binding.​</p>

    <p>You can attend mediation sessions in person or remotely (for example by video or phone). You do not have to be in
      the same room or call as your ex-partner.  </p>

    <p>Mediation:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>is usually cheaper and quicker than going to court​</li>
      <li>is flexible to your needs​</li>
      <li>can be partly or fully funded by government voucher scheme​</li>
      <li>lets you have control over the outcome </li>

    <!-- Start: Collaborative law  -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Collaborative law </h3>

    <p>In this approach you and the other parent each hire a lawyer then you and the lawyers all meet to negotiate
      face-to-face.</p>

    <p>Collaborative law can be a good choice if you can communicate with the other parent but have complex legal issues
      to resolve. This approach works best if you trust the other parent and can co-operate with them.​</p>

    <p>Collaborative law: </p>

    <!-- Start: Lawyer negotiation -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-9">Lawyer negotiation</h3>
    <p>When you resolve your child arrangements using lawyer negotiation, you hire a lawyer to negotiate arrangements
      for you. The type of lawyer you use is called a solicitor. If the other parent also uses a lawyer then the two
      lawyers will speak directly to one another. This approach means that you don't have to deal directly with the
      other parent if you don’t want to. </p>

    <p>You can still hire a lawyer to negotiate on your behalf even if the other parent chooses not to use one. </p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation can be a good option if your relationship is difficult and you'd prefer not to meet, or if you
      don't trust the other parent.</p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>means you don’t have to deal with the other parent directly</li>
      <li>is usually quicker and less stressful than going to court</li>
      <li>can be expensive</li>

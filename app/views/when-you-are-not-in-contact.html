    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Making child arrangements when you aren’t in contact</h1>

    <p>If things are difficult with your former partner, there are a few ways to make child arrangements without having
      to be in direct contact with each other.</p>
     
    <p>The cheapest way may be to try using shuttle mediation. With shuttle mediation, you and the other parent can sit
      in separate rooms while the mediator 'shuttles' between you. This is a good option if you'd prefer not to meet the
      other parent face-to-face.</p>
     
    <p>Mediation is not relationship counselling. </p>

    <p>Shuttle mediation:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>is usually cheaper and quicker than going to court​</li>
      <li>is flexible to your needs​</li>
      <li>can be partly or fully funded by government voucher scheme​</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Family mediation is a process in which an independent, professionally trained mediator helps you work out
          arrangements for children after separation.</p>
         
        <p>Mediation can also be helpful if you’re updating your existing child arrangements. You may find it less
          stressful than going to court, and cheaper than lawyer negotiation.</p>
         
        <p>The mediator will help you find a solution which works for you both and will explain what needs to happen to
          make an agreement between you legally binding. </p>

        <p>How it works:</p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>Find a mediator.</li>
          <li>Book an initial meeting, known as a Mediation Information and Assessment Meeting (MIAM).</li>
          <li>Attend as many mediation sessions as you need.​</li>
          <li>Get an agreement in writing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Get up to £500 towards the cost of mediation​</h3>
        <p>You can usually get a voucher worth up to £500 to pay for family mediation, no matter what you earn. The
          voucher usually pays for at least 2 mediation sessions.​</p>
        ​
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to get a mediation voucher​</h3>
        <p>Ask an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.familymediationcouncil.org.uk/find-local-mediator/">accredited
            mediator</a> to apply for the voucher. You do not need to
          pay upfront for any sessions the
          voucher covers.</p>

    <!-- Start: Lawyer negotiation -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Lawyer negotiation</h3>
    <p>With lawyer negotiation, you hire a lawyer to negotiate arrangements for you. The type of lawyer you use is
      called a solicitor. Often the other parent will also use a lawyer and the two lawyers will speak directly to one
      another. This approach means that you don't have to deal directly with the other parent if you don’t want to.</p>

    <p>You can still hire a lawyer to negotiate on your behalf even if the other parent chooses not to use one.</p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation can be a good option if your relationship is difficult and you'd prefer not to meet, or if you
      don’t trust the other parent. It can be expensive. It may be quicker and less stressful than court.</p>

    <p>Lawyer negotiation:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>means you don't have to deal with the other parent directly</li>
      <li>is usually quicker and less stressful than going to court</li>
      <li>can be expensive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The agreement reached will not be legally binding. You can ask your lawyer to submit it to court to make it
      legally binding if that is what you want.</p>

    <!-- Start: Going to court -->
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-9">Going to court</h3>

    <p>You'll need to go to court if you've tried other suitable options and still can't agree arrangements, or you're
      worried about the welfare of you or your children.</p>

    <p class="govuk-!-margin-top-6">Court:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>can take a long time</li>
      <li>can be expensive and stressful</li>
      <li>often takes more than one court session to get a resolution</li>
      <li>results in a legal judgement that can be enforced</li>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>Find out if you can get representation.</li>
